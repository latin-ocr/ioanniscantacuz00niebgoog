Hist. of the D. and F. ol tho R. E o. LXIII. le-

»The namo and situation of the emperor John

sity. llis-memoriale ol forty years extend from ’

, the revolt of the younger Andronicus to his own

abdication ol the empire‚ audit isohserved, that,
lite Moses and Caesar, he was the principal ao-

] tor in the scenos which he describes. But in this

eloquent work, we should vainly seek the sin·
oerity of an hero ora peniteat. Retired in a
cloyster from the vices and passione of the world
he presente not a confession, hut an apology, ol'

the lile of an ambitious statesman. Instead ol .

unlolding the true counsels and characters of men,
he displays the smooth and. specious surlace ol

2 events, highly· varnished with his own praises and

those of his friends. Their motivas are always
pure; their* ends always legitimate:¹ they oonspire⁸
and rebel without any views oi interest3 and the
violence 'which they inflict or suffer is celebrated .
as the spontaneous effect ol' reason and viriae«
